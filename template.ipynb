The objective function calculates net present value of elevating the house to a given height, considering both the cost of raising the house and the discounted expected costs of future flood damage. The states of the world considered include sea level rise outcome randomly selected from a set of possible outcomes, a generalized extreme value distribution approximating possible storm surge events, and discount rate.\n",

        "    This assumption might be \"good enough\" depending on the range of options in the SOWs capturing uncertainty. In this case, using a generalize extreme values distribution is probably not a very good assumption to capture possible storm surge events.\n",

A more sophisticated analysis might take into account factors that affect the cost of raising the house at different times as well as additional flood-influencing factors besides sea level rise and storm surge distribution, such as changes in land use."
